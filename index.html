	Assignment 5-3 Instructions: Convert the PIG app to objects

	In this assignment, you’ll be converting the PIG application from chapter 12 so it uses 
	objects. When you’re done, the application will work the same as it did before, but the 
	code will be organized differently.

	To start this game, you enter the names for the two players and click the New Game button. 
	Then, the message below the names indicates whose turn it is. When the game is over, 
	a dialog box announces the winner.

	1. Open and run the starter folder, pig.
	2. Review the library_die.js file. Note that it contains a class named Die with no properties and a single method that rolls a die.
	3. Review the library_pig.js file. Note that it contains a class named Pig that has a property 
	that’s an object created from the Die class. The Pig class has a constructor() function with 
	five data properties, a read-only accessor property, and three methods.
	
	*4. Review the library_game.js file. Note that it’s an object literal with three data 
	properties, one read-only accessor property, and five methods. The start() method and 
	isValid read-only property are already coded for you, and the other methods have comments 
	indicating what they should do. Now, finish the code for those four methods and make them 
	cascading methods when you can.
	*5. Review the pig.js file and note that it supplies the ready event handler and the click 
	event handler of the New Game button. There are also starts for the click event handlers 
	for the Roll and Hold buttons, which you need to finish. These handlers should use the 
	methods of the game object in the library_game.js file.
	*6. In index.html, add the text in the <small> tag to your name and student number.
